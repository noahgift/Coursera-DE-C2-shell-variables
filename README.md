# Coursera-DE-C2-shell-variables

## Goal:   Learn to use shell variables and source them

Let's practice using and sourcing shell variables

### Part 1: Sourcing a script full of shell variables

1. Source `projectAlias.sh` by running the command `source projectAlias.sh`
2. View the current aliases by running the command `alias`
3. What do you see?

### Part 2: Use the aliases

1. Use the `fooTOP` alias by typing it in the terminal?
2. What do you see?
3. Now use the `barTOP` alias by typing it in the terminal?
4. Did it work?  If not explain why and figure out a way you could fix it?

### Part 3: echo sourced variables

1. Let's use the sourced variables in a statement:  `echo "I enjoy eating an $fruit after a tasty $meal for dinner"`
2. What do you see?
3. Use the shell variables you sourced earlier to print a statement in Bash you created yourself.
